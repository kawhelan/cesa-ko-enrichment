## Introduction

This report summarizes Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis to investigate functional categories and biological pathways affected by CESA knockout in *Physcomitrium patens*. The analysis is based on RNA-seq data and identifies differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the mutant relative to the background genome. GO enrichment highlights overrepresented biological processes, while KEGG pathway analysis identifies significantly enriched metabolic and signaling pathways. Together, these analyses provide insight into the molecular responses triggered by CESA disruption.

# Load data

# Load GO PANTHER tables
bp <- read.delim("data/PANTHER_bp_analysis_table.txt", skip = 11, header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

```{r clean-data, include=FALSE}

# Clean data

# Define PANTHER cleaning function
clean_panther <- function(df) {
  colnames(df)[1:8] <- c("GO_term", "REF_count", "DEG_count", "Expected", "OverUnder",
                         "Fold_Enrichment", "P_value", "FDR")
  df %>%
    filter(!is.na(FDR) & FDR < 0.05) %>% # Keep only rows where FDR is not NA and less than 0.05 (significant terms)
    mutate(
      # Make sure columns are numeric
      Fold_Enrichment = as.numeric(Fold_Enrichment),
      FDR = as.numeric(FDR),

### GO Dot Plot (Top 30 Biological Processes)
A dot plot was created to visualize the top 30 biological processes enriched among CESA knockout DEGs, incorporating gene ratio, gene count, and -log10 FDR values. This figure directly addressed the research question by identifying statistically significant biological processes activated in response to CESA disruption.



```{r GO-dotplot, echo=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=8, fig.cap="**Figure 1.** Secondary metabolism, cytokinesis, and cell wall organization processes are enriched in CesA knockout DEGs. GO enrichment analysis of biological processes (BP) was performed on DEGs from *P. patens* CESA knockout lines (n = 3 biological replicates) using the PANTHER classification system. The top 30 enriched GO terms were plotted based on gene ratio (DEG count/reference count). Statistical significance was assessed via FDR-adjusted p-values, and -log10(FDR) was used to color the dots. Enriched processes include secondary metabolic pathways, cytokinesis, ethylene signaling, and cell wall biogenesis, reflecting metabolic reprogramming and structural adaptation to CESA loss."}

# GO enrichment dot plot

# Sort GO terms by ascending FDR (most significant first) and select the top 30 based on FDR
bp_top <- bp %>% arrange(FDR) %>% slice(1:30)

# Create GO dot plot
GO_dotplot <- ggplot(bp_top, aes(x = GeneRatio, y = reorder(GO_term, GeneRatio))) +
  geom_point(aes(size = DEG_count, color = neg_log10_FDR)) +
  scale_color_gradientn(
    colors = c("red", "orange", "gold", "blue", "purple"),
    name = expression(-log[10](FDR))
  ) +

  theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +
  xlim(0, 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Gene Ratio", y = "GO Term")

### KEGG Dot Plot (Top 30 Pathways)
A KEGG dot plot was generated to display the top 30 enriched pathways based on gene ratio and FDR significance. This analysis connected differential gene expression to known metabolic and regulatory pathways and identified enriched biological pathways associated with transcriptional adaptation following CESA loss.



```{r KEGG-dotplot, echo=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=8, fig.cap="**Figure 2.** CESA knockout DEGs are enriched in secondary metabolite biosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism, and cell wall-related pathways. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis was performed on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from P. patens CesA knockout lines (n = 3 biological replicates) using DAVID functional annotation. Pathways with Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-values (FDR) < 0.05 were retained. The top 30 enriched pathways were plotted based on gene ratio (DEG count/reference population count). Enriched pathways included secondary metabolite biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, polyketide biosynthesis, and cell wall biogenesis, alongside regulatory functions such as ethylene signaling and water transport."}
