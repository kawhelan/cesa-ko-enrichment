## Introduction

This report summarizes protein domain enrichment analysis using Pfam annotations to assess how CESA knockout in *Physcomitrium patens* affects the composition of protein domains among differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The analysis is based on RNA-seq data and compares the frequency of protein domains in DEGs relative to the background genome.

### Pfam Bar Plot (Top 10 Domains) 
A bar plot was generated to visualize the top 10 Pfam domains most frequently associated with CESA knockout DEGs. This exploratory figure provided a broad overview of which protein families were most commonly affected by CesA disruption, highlighting early trends toward kinase signaling, transporter activity, and transcription factor functions. 



```{r top10-barplot, fig.width=9, fig.height=4, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="**Figure 1.** Kinase signaling, transporter, and transcription factor domains are highly represented in CESA knockout DEGs. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from *P. patens* CESA knockout lines (n = 3 biological replicates) were identified via RNA-seq and annotated with Pfam domains using Phytozome. The top 10 domain frequencies across all DEGs were calculated and grouped into functional categories. Kinase signaling, transporter, and transcription factor domains were the most frequently represented, suggesting broad reprogramming of signaling and regulatory pathways in response to CESA loss."}

pfam_annotated <- pfam_all %>%
  left_join(pfam_df, by = "Pfam") %>% # Add domain descriptions and short names by joining with Pfam descriptions
  mutate(label = paste(Pfam, "-", str_remove(Description, "(anon|:|;).*"))) # Create a label that combines the Pfam ID and a cleaned-up description

# Select the top 10 most frequent Pfam domains based on their counts
top10 <- pfam_annotated %>% slice_max(n, n = 10)

# Optional: add functional categories to the top 10 domains

### Pfam Heatmap (Upregulated vs. Downregulated Domains)
A heatmap was created to compare Pfam domain frequencies between upregulated and downregulated DEGs, giving insight into domain-specific regulation patterns. This analysis revealed that kinase domains tended to be upregulated, while transcription factor domains were often associated with downregulated genes. Although the heatmap supported the hypothesis of functional reprogramming, it serves as a descriptive tool rather than a statistically inferential result.



```{r heatmap, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="**Figure 2.** Kinase and transcription factor domains exhibit distinct regulation patterns in CESA knockout DEGs. Pfam domains were analyzed separately in upregulated and downregulated DEGs from CESA knockout RNA-seq data (n = 3 biological replicates). The top 20 most frequent domains were selected based on total counts across both categories. The heatmap shows that kinase domains are more frequently associated with upregulated DEGs, while transcription factor domains are more prevalent among downregulated DEGs, indicating differential domain-specific regulation."}

### Pfam Dot Plot (Top Domains by p-value)
An exploratory dot plot displaying Pfam domains ranked by fold enrichment and -log10 FDR was used to explore domain enrichment trends. This visualization included both significant and borderline significant domains, providing a broader view of potential functional shifts and useful for assessing overall patterns. 


```{r enrichment-dotplot, echo=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=6, fig.cap="**Figure 3.** Kinase signaling and defense-related domains show enrichment trends in CESA knockout DEGs relative to the background genome. Fisher’s exact test was used to compare the frequency of Pfam domains in CESA knockout DEGs (n = 3 biological replicates) against the full *P. patens* background gene set. Fold enrichment and FDR-adjusted p-values were calculated for all domains. The plot displays the top 15 enriched domains ranked by adjusted p-value, including both significant (FDR < 0.05) and borderline domains. Kinase signaling and defense-related domains rank among the top hits, suggesting potential activation of stress-response and signaling pathways following CESA disruption."}

### Pfam Lollipop Plot (Significant Domains) 
A lollipop plot was generated to highlight Pfam domains that were significantly enriched among CESA knockout DEGs (FDR < 0.05). This figure directly addressed the research question by identifying protein families involved in stress responses, secondary metabolism, and photosynthesis, showing specific functional categories activated in response to CESA loss.


```{r enrichment-lollipop, echo=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=3, fig.cap="**Figure 4.** Secondary metabolism, photosynthesis, and stress-response domains are significantly enriched in CESA knockout DEGs. Pfam domains were assessed for enrichment in DEGs from *P. patens* CESA knockout lines (n = 3 biological replicates) relative to the genome background using Fisher’s exact test with false discovery rate (FDR) correction. Only domains with FDR < 0.05 are shown. Four Pfam domains were significantly enriched, including domains associated with secondary metabolism (chalcone/stilbene synthase), photosynthesis (ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase), and stress responses (cytochrome P450)."}
